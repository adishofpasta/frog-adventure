# Lily the Frog
This is my first game made in Godot. A little explorative adventure of mine in the engine, if you will.

You can find a playable version hosted in [my itch.io page](https://a-dish-of-pasta.itch.io/lily-the-frog).


## Development
The game was born as a participant for VimJam 5, although it did not enter the competition eventually.

In its current state, the gameplay is mostly a template for future expansions, with things to do that may not be limited to placing lilypads.


## Credits
Sprites, fonts and other graphics are hand-made by me.

Soundtracks are composed by me via [beepbox.co](https://www.beepbox.co/).

Rainforest loop and frog SFX were part of the [No-Code GameDev Bundle](https://www.humblebundle.com/software/no-code-gamedev-bundle-software).

The color palette is adapted from Coral 4, found in [lospec.com](https://lospec.com/palette-list/coral-4).
